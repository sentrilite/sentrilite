## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

```
1. Install System requirements:

Open ports 8765 and 3000

2. **Unzip the bundle:**

unzip sentrilite_agent_bundle.zip
cd sentrilite

3. Load the bpf program:
sudo ./install.sh

4. Open net.conf and configure:
license_file=license.key    # Path to your license file
iface=enX0 # your ethernet or your network interface

5. Launch the Server:
sudo ./sentrilite

7. Open the Dashboard:
Copy the dashboard.html to /var/www/html or web root directory.
Open dashboard.html in your browser: http://<YOUR-SERVER-IP>/dashboard.html
You should see live events appear in real-time.

Log format in the Web UI:
[2025-04-14T00:12:32.008Z] PID=1234 COMM=ssh CMD=/bin/bash ARG= IP=127.0.0.1 TYPE=EXECVE

8. Open the Main Dashboard:
Copy the main.html to /var/www/html on your main admin server.
Open the main.html in your browser: http://<YOUR-SERVER-IP>/main.html
Click choose file and select a file containing your server lists.
Example file format:
Server_1_ip_address,prod
Server_2_ip_address,test

Once uploaded correctly, Sentrilite agent will monitor and show status/alerts/AI insights
for these servers.

For more detail information, refer to dashboard_usage.README
