# Sentrilite Main Dashboard - Usage Guide

This dashboard provides a centralized control panel for managing multiple EDR/XDR-enabled Linux servers
running the Sentrilite agent. It allows you to upload a server list, monitor live status and alerts, and
apply EDR/XDR rules across your infrastructure.

🧩 Features
    ✅ Upload a list of servers to manage
    ✅ Auto-fetch health and alert status from each server via WebSocket
    ✅ View and edit server groups (tags)
    ✅ Apply EDR rules (match key/value with risk level)
    ✅ Apply XDR rules (block/allow IPs or ports)
    ✅ Filter and select servers by group tags
    ✅ Theme toggle (light/dark)
    ✅ Export dashboard view for re-importing later

# Main Dashboard - Usage Guide

📁 File Format for Upload

Upload a .txt file containing a list of servers to manage, one per line. Optionally, you can specify a tag (group) for each server:

192.168.1.10,PROD
192.168.1.11,DEV
192.168.1.12

Tags are optional and can be edited later directly in the dashboard UI.

---

# Steps:

Open main.html in a browser (preferably served via HTTP for WebSocket support).

Upload Server List using the "Upload Server List" button.

Select servers manually via checkbox, or apply rules using group filters.

Apply EDR Rules:
    Match Key (e.g. cmd, comm, arg1, ip)
    Match Values (comma-separated)
    Tags (optional)
    Risk Level (1 = High, 2 = Medium, 3 = Low)

Apply XDR Rules:
    Block/Allow
    IP and/or Port (or port range)
    Optional server tag filter

Export View: Use "Download Dashboard" to export current servers + group tags to a .txt file.

---

# Notes:

main.html only shows CMD= and ARG= when they are non-empty for cleaner logs.
Server selection is based on checkbox OR matching group tag (inclusive OR).
Tags are editable inline in the "Groups" column after uploading.

# Sentrilite Dashboard.html - Usage Guide

This dashboard provides a real-time view of system activity, alerts, and threat indicators based on eBPF events captured by the Sentrilite agent.

Simply open `dashboard.html` in a modern browser (e.g. Chrome or Firefox) to start visualizing live events.

---

## ✅ What the Dashboard Shows

You will see:

- **Live Process & Network Activity** — traced via `execve()`, `connect()`, `accept()`, `socket()`, etc.
- **Risk Classification** — events are automatically color-coded:
  - 🔴 **High Risk** (Red) → e.g. intrusions, data exfiltration, reverse shells
  - 🟠 **Medium Risk** (Orange) → suspicious but not confirmed
  - 🟢 **Low Risk** (Green) → normal system activity

- **Event Filters** — filter by UID, IP, command, or tag in real-time.
- **Tagging Engine** — events may carry tags such as:
  - `intruder`, `info-disclosure`, `scanner`, `exfiltration`, `unexpected-service`, etc.

## 🛠️ Interactive Features

### 🎛 Sidebar: EDR + XDR Manager

- **Add Rule**: Define custom detection rules (match `cmd`, `arg1`, `ip`, etc.)  
- **View/Delete Rules**: Inspect or clear current detection rules  
- **Clear Events**: Reset the live log

### 🛡️ XDR Rule Management

- Add port/IP-based **blocking or allowlisting rules**
- Supports:
  - IP + Port

## 🌐 Remote Access Setup

To serve the dashboard remotely:

1. **Install nginx** on your server:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nginx
   sudo cp dashboard.html /var/www/html/
   sudo systemctl start nginx

2. Edit Websocket connection in dashboard.html
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://<your-server-ip>:8765");
